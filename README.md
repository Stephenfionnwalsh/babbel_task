Babbel Bowling Scoreboard Challenge

I went over the three hours for the task so I'll just leave it as it is.
There are a few things I could to improve it and it is a bit repetitive in places.
I tend to think of challenge in the simplest possible way and then try to improve it.
So for the challenge is only applicable to one player but it could be extended to include
more.

The implementation is pretty simple and I left all logic in the same file.
It follows a standard bowling score system. Initially, it checks if the first bowl was a
strike or not.
If yes then the player has two more bowls and a possible maximum score of thirty.
If not then the player only has one more bowl and a possible maximum score of ten.

The total score is then calculated using a reduce function.

The score and scores for each round and bowl are rendered to the page.

On Refresh new scores are shown.
